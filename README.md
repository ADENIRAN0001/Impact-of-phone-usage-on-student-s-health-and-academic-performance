## Project Overview
This project focuses on the impact of the use of smartphone by students on their health and how it affects their academic performance. Smartphones have a lot of educational values which helps students to improve on learning and obtain excellent results in their examinations. However, many students are seriously affected by the use of smartphone. It has caused more harms than good to their health and academic performance of many students. 
## Data Collection. 
The Dataset was collected from Kaggle. Kaggle is a well-known website where different kinds of Dataset can be obtained for the purpose of Data analysis, modelling and practice. 
### Demography of the students
-	The age range of the students between 16-35.
-	A total of one hundred (100) students responded to the survey.
-	Eighty-one (81) of the respondents are male while nineteen (19) are female. 
-	Most of the respondents use an android phone while a few uses iOS.
## Data cleaning
The Dataset went through a proper cleaning and wrangling process. Inconsistent responses were removed. A Data reliability test was conducted on the Dataset to ensure consistency and validity.
## Data cleaning tool
-	Microsoft Excel

## Research questions 
The following questions were queried (asked) from the Dataset
1.	What is the major reason why students are using their phone?
2.	What is the average time a student use on the phone?
3.	Which education App is the most commonly used by the student?
4.	What are the health effects of prolonged use of phone?
5.	Which health effect is common among the students?
6.	How can this health issue be best tackled?
7.	Does the use of phone affect the academic performance of the students?
## Data Query tool
-	Google Sheet
## Methodology 
The following steps were taken to complete the project
-	Dataset was uploaded into Microsoft Excel.
-	Some Microsoft Excel function was used to clean the Dataset.
-	Calculation such as maximum, minimum, count, etc. including If statements were used to summarize the dataset.
-	The Dataset was uploaded into Microsoft Power BI 
-	The Dataset initially transformed before being uploaded into the main framework of Power BI where the visualization will be done.
-	Column distribution, column profile, column quality was checked for each column and were adjusted until each of the column had 100% valid cells with no null or empty cell.
-	The dashboards were created.
-	The dashboard showcased the summary of the data, charts on phone usage, health effect and how it affects their academic performance.
## Data analysis/Result
### Data analysis tools
-	Microsoft Excel
-	Google sheet
-	Microsoft Power BI
### The Dashboard
The features of my Microsoft Power BI Dashboard are listed below;
-	The dashboard was created showcasing the total number of students, total number of male and female as well as other important information about the students.
-	A total of four dashboards was created with each showcasing a unique part of the data visuals. 
-	The first dashboard shows the summary of the data for a quick understanding of what is data is all about.
-	The second dashboard charts about the phone usage by the students.
-	The third dashboard shows how the use of phone affects the health of the students.
-	The last dashboard shows how the use of phone affects the academic performance of students
## Results
1.	The major reason why students are using their phone is for note taking App. These are Apps that helps get notes on the topics taught in class and solutions to assignments. 
2.	The average time a student use on the phone daily is between four (4) - six (6) hours.

5.	The health effect common among the students is a combination of sleep disturbance, anxiety and mental stress.
6.	This health issue caused by phone usage be best tackled by the use of blue light filter.
7.	The use of phone affects the academic performance of the students. 
## Insights
1.	The use of phone by the student has an overall advantage for the students especially in this Tech age. 
2.	The option of preventing student from using a smartphone will never be effective. 
3.	Most of the students agreed that the use of phone is affecting their health and academic performance. 
4.	Social media is the second highest phone activities by the student while the highest is a combination of different activities such as social media,  web-browsing, messaging etc
## Conclusion
Smartphones have a lot of educational values which can be harnessed by students to achieve great feats in their academics. The internet has enough educational resources that can help any student to obtain excellent results in their examinations. This will drastically reduce failure in most examination in the country including the menace of examination malpractices. However, many students are seriously affected by the use of smartphone. They use the phone majorly for non-academic activities. The health effects of phone usage are majorly sleeping disturbance which will lead to mental stress, anxiety, migraine and lack of concentration in the class. This can be reduced if student use blue light filter and reduce the time spend with the phone.

## Recommendation
1.	Parent should install blue light filter in the rooms of their children.
2.	Students should always use reading mode feature on their phone. 
3.	Parents can use the parental mode feature in most smartphone to reduce the amount of time student use with their phones.
4.	Parents can get reading spectacles for their children to reduce the rays of light coming into their eyes. 
5.	Parents/students should install educational Apps to aid learning. 
## Limitation
1.	Limited available Dataset on education.
