## Data cleaning
The Dataset went through a proper cleaning and wrangling process. Inconsistent responses were removed. A Data reliability test was conducted on the Dataset to ensure consistency and validity.
## Data cleaning tool
-	Microsoft Excel

## Research questions 
The following questions were queried (asked) from the Dataset
1.	What is the major reason why students are using their phone?
2.	What is the average time a student use on the phone?
3.	Which education App is the most commonly used by the student?
4.	What are the health effects of prolonged use of phone?
5.	Which health effect is common among the students?
6.	How can this health issue be best tackled?
7.	Does the use of phone affect the academic performance of the students?
## Data Query tool
-	Google Sheet
## Methodology 
The following steps were taken to complete the project
-	Dataset was uploaded into Microsoft Excel.
-	Some Microsoft Excel function was used to clean the Dataset.
-	Calculation such as maximum, minimum, count, etc. including If statements were used to summarize the dataset.
-	The Dataset was uploaded into Microsoft Power BI 
-	The Dataset initially transformed before being uploaded into the main framework of Power BI where the visualization will be done.
-	Column distribution, column profile, column quality was checked for each column and were adjusted until each of the column had 100% valid cells with no null or empty cell.
-	The dashboards were created.
-	The dashboard showcased the summary of the data, charts on phone usage, health effect and how it affects their academic performance.
## Data analysis/Result
### Data analysis tools
-	Microsoft Excel
-	Google sheet
-	Microsoft Power BI
### The Dashboard
The features of my Microsoft Power BI Dashboard are listed below;
-	The dashboard was created showcasing the total number of students, total number of male and female as well as other important information about the students.
-	A total of four dashboards was created with each showcasing a unique part of the data visuals. 
-	The first dashboard shows the summary of the data for a quick understanding of what is data is all about.
-	The second dashboard charts about the phone usage by the students.
-	The third dashboard shows how the use of phone affects the health of the students.

## Conclusion
Smartphones have a lot of educational values which can be harnessed by students to achieve great feats in their academics. The internet has enough educational resources that can help any student to obtain excellent results in their examinations. This will drastically reduce failure in most examination in the country including the menace of examination malpractices. However, many students are seriously affected by the use of smartphone. They use the phone majorly for non-academic activities.
